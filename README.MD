This kit provides a template for observing videos of horse training systems and evaluating them relative to the ISES (International Society for Equitation Science) Principles of Equitation Science.

This kit is the distributable version of the ethnology-based evaluation methodology, described in:
Steve North, Ann Hemingway, Andrew McLean, Harriet Laurie and Caroline Ellis-Hill. 2016. Evaluating a natural horsemanship program in relation to the ISES first principles of horse training. In proceedings of The 12th International Society for Equitation Science Conference (ISES2016). June 23-25. IFCE (Institut Français du Cheval et de L’équitation), Saumur, France.

Steve's modifications to CowLog in this version are:

In index.html, the ISES principles ethogram behaviour numbers are hard-coded and come up immediately, ready to use.
All paths to CSS, JavaScrip, images etc. are now relative.

This version of CowLog can be run locally on a device, and it does not require an Internet connection to save the output file. The local text file saving is achieved using a BLOB. In cowlog.js, see line 697.
