<H2>Setting up a project</H2>

<h3>General Settings - tab</h3>

You will need to define a project before you can start coding. Choose
"File -&gt; New Project" from the menu. You can define the name of the
project and other basic information. 

Here is a description of less self explanatory fields:

<ul>
  <li><b>Video directory.</b> This is where CowLog will look for your
  video files by default.</li>
  <li><b>Data directory.</b></li> This is where CowLog stores your
  codings.
  <li><b>Behavioral codes.</b> Here you can define your
  ethogram. Write behaviors as comma separated list with behaviors
  for each class on a separate line. If you'll leave this empty
  CowLog will use the default numbered codes.</li>
</ul>

If your project uses modifiers check the <b>Use modifiers</b> check
box and write the behaviors that have modifiers in the <b>Codes with
  modifiers</b> box as a comma sepated list (behaviors from all
classes in the same list).  

<h3>Video Player Settings - tab</h3>

You can use either <a href ="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a> or
<a href="http://videolan.org">VLC player</a> as a video player.

<p><b>MPlayer</b> comes with CowLog Windows installations and can be
  installed on most Linux distributions trough the package manager
  and is avalaible as a binary for Mac OS X. You can also choose
  video driver for MPlayer if the default option doesn't work on your hardware.</p> 

<p><b>VLC</b> player needs to be installed separately on all
  platforms. Once VLC is installed CowLog should find it automatically.
</p>

<p>Both video players should offer similar coding experience for
  video formats that they support. If you experience problems with
  your video format you can try changing the player. </p>

<H2>Coding session</H2>

<p>After you have defined you project you can start coding. Choose "File
-&gt; New Subject" to start coding. The name of the datafile will be
formed from <b>Subject</b> and <b>Start time</b> fields. You can
choose on or several videos using the <b>Video file(s):</b> button. If
you choose several videos they will all be played at the same
  time.</p> Click <b>OK</b> and you should see the video opened and you can
start coding. 

<b>END</b> the coding session using the stop-button. It will add end
time and code to your datafile You should do this even if the video
has ended before you press it.


Code behaviors by pressing coding buttons with the mouse or by
 pressing alt+''underlined character'' from the keyboard. e.g to code
 behavior 1 from column 1 press ''alt+1''. You can see five previous
 code in current code indicator.

You can cancel incorrect codes with the <b>Undo</b> button.


<H2>Analyzing the results</H2>

There is no support for analysing the data from this version yet. We
have found out that almost every project needs some specific work in
doing the analysis and its quite difficult to come up with good
general analysis code without significant input. However, I'll try to
write some analysis code for simple cases in the future.

The result format depends on the selected configuration.  If there are
no modifiers the result format has three columns:


<ol>
<li>Time. Seconds from beginning.</li>
<li>Code. The behavioral code.</li>
<li>Class. The class that the code belongs to.</li>
</ol>

If modifiers are used there are result format will be slightly different: The first column will contain the time and the following columns contains the behavioral codes followed by potential modifiers.
